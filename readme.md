# 💼 JobPortal — Modern Full-Stack Recruitment Platform

JobPortal is a high-performance **MERN** application designed to streamline the connection between top-tier talent and recruiters. Built with a focus on modern aesthetics (glassmorphism/minimalism) and technical efficiency, it offers a dual-role experience for Students and Recruiters.

## 🚀 Key Modules & Functionality

### 👤 User & Authentication
- **Secure Auth**: Implements JWT-based authentication stored in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct permissions for `Student` and `Recruiter` across the entire application.
- **Dynamic Profiles**: Students can update their bio, skills, and upload resumes, with real-time feedback via **Sonner** toasts.

### 🏢 Recruiter Workflow
- **Company Branding**: Register organizations and upload hi-res logos directly to **Cloudinary**.
- **Job Orchestration**: Full CRUD for job postings with detailed metadata (salary, location, type, experience level).
- **Candidate Pipeline**: A dedicated dashboard for every job listing to view applicants, download resumes, and update hiring statuses (**Pending**, **Accepted**, **Rejected**).

### 🔍 Student & Candidate Experience
- **Advanced Job Search**: Instant filtering by title, company, or location on the Home and Jobs pages.
- **Company Directory**: A public "Browse" tab to explore all registered organizations and their mission.
- **Application Status**: Track all your submissions in one place with color-coded status badges.
- **Smart Logic**: Prevents duplicate applications and provides instant loading states during the submission process.
